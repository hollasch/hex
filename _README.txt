    hex: A hexadecimal dump for the Windows command line


    DESCRIPTION

    This is a simple hexadecimal print utility that reads input from the
    standard input stream or from files specified on the command line. See
    hex.html for usage information.


    BUILDING

    In the future I may convert this project to Visual Studio, but for now a
    simple makefile does just fine. The makefile is meant to be run with the
    Visual Studio 'nmake' command. Run 'nmake all' to build hex.exe.
