Name

    hex - Dump file or stream in hexadecimal and ASCII

Synopsis

    hex [-?bwlv] [-s] [-e] [file] ... [file]

Description

    hex is a filter that reads data from either standard input (if no
    filenames are supplied) or from the list of files, and dumps the data
    in hexadecimal and ASCII. Note that options may be prefixed with either
    a '-' or with a '/' character, and that you can put spaces between the
    switch letter and the argument (e.g. "-e200" or "-e 200").

    To specify hexadecimal values, prefix with "0x". To specify octal
    values, prefix with "0" (zero). For example, 200 = 0310 = 0xC8.

    Options include the following:

     -?  Display help information.

     -b  Display output grouped by bytes.

     -w  Display output grouped by words (2 bytes).

     -l  Display output grouped by longwords (4 bytes / default).

     -s  Start the dump at the given location (octal, decimal or hex).

     -e  End the dump at the given location (octal, decimal or hex).

     -v  Display all lines (default is to mark blocks of redundant lines
         with a "====" in the address field).

    Important: From the command line, DOS does redirection streams as text,
    rather than binary. This means that if you want to look at a binary
    data file, you should probably specify the filename on the command line
    (e.g. "hex foo.xyz") rather than as a redirection (e.g. "hex <foo.xyz").
    In the latter case, a Ctrl-Z character looks like an end-of-file, and
    your binary files will likely appear much shorter than they really are.

Examples

    To dump the contents of file frotz.zzz to screen:

        hex frotz.zzz | more

    To dump the words from 0x200 to 0x240 for files file1, file2 & file3:

        hex -s0x200 -e 0x240 -w file1 file2 file3
