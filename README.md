HEX
=====
A hexadecimal dump for the Windows command line.


DESCRIPTION
-------------
This is a simple hexadecimal print utility that reads input from the
standard input stream or from files specified on the command line. See
doc/hex.html for usage information.


BUILDING
----------
This probject builds in Visual Studio, though I'm planning on adding Mac OSX
support with XCode.


INSTALLATION
--------------
hex.exe is the single output file for this tool. Copy it to any location on
your command and use as-is. There is no other installation.
